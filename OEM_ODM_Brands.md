OEMs, ODMs and Brandings
========================

Just a "shortlist" (heh) of known OEMs, ODMs and other Brands related to the laptops found in here.

ASUS
----
Known to most.
* *Pros*: Over-the-top game sub-brand
* *Cons*: Over-the-top game sub-brand
* [Customer Site](https://www.asus.com/)

Dell
----
A massively known megacorp that has its tendrils in so many sectors of computing it's hard to keep track
* *Pros*: Massive selection, customisability
* *Cons*: Precious few G-Sync options to choose from, and none with Linux out of the box
* *Ish*: the G series 5590 G-Sync is hardware-wise potentially a GSync unit, but it's unconfirmed
* [Customer Site](https://www.dell.com/)

Clevo
-----
A known ODM that rebrands their stuff for other stores, brands, etc. Essentially a customisable design, which is dope. If this document lists a clevo-based rebranding, consider that we're talking specifically about the G-Sync units. Other ODMs exist!
* *Pros*: Customisability
* *Cons*: @cybik says "looks like my G55vw from 2012, and we're in 2019"; no direct sales

Santech
-------
Clevo-based Italian re-brand.

EuroCom
-------
Clevo-based Canadian re-brand.
