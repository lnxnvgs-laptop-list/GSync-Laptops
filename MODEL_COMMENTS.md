More Comments on specific models!
=================================

ASUS Zephyrus S Series
----------------------
* Per a [UltrabookRewview note](https://www.ultrabookreview.com/26602-asus-rog-zephyrus-m-gu502/), the Zephyrus S line is the only line to posess Dual Optimus/GSync (or nVidia-driven GSync).
  * `Thereâ€™s no GSync support on this series, the dual Optimus/GSync mode remaining a distinctive feature of the Zephyrus S lineup`

Lenovo Y740 series
------------------
* A G-Sync *option* for the Y540 is rumored.
* [Review](https://www.ultrabookreview.com/26518-lenovo-legion-y740-review/)
  * This review has this specific line: `However, the Intel GPU is disabled by default, in order to allow for GSync, so you will have to boot in BIOS and opt for the Switchable Graphics mode to actually activate it.` This bodes well for people that may want to immediately install Linux on this unit without even booting into the Windows system *once*.
* The keyboard setup appears to be an oddity. Touch Typists beware.
* GTX1060Ti is only where explicitely stated/listed - it's a specific configurator option, when looking at the 17inch Y740 series page
